                ash. They can also be created by human activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories.</p>

            <p>Football, also called association football or soccer, is a game involving two teams of 11 players who try
                to maneuver the ball into the other team's goal without using their hands or arms. The team that scores
                more goals wins. Football is the world's most popular ball game in numbers of participants and
                spectators. I am so proud that we did so good and I am very happy for the school.</p>

            <p>Yay!! I am so happy. and I love Science! What is science definition for kids? Science is the process of
                learning about the natural world through observation and experimentation. Scientists use evidence, along
                with active thinking, to explain what is happening in the natural world.

                    makes it easy for students to get food from these canteens. On a busy day when mothers dont get
                    time to pack lunchboxes or snack boxes, these canteens are
                    really handy and a lifesaver. Our school also has a canteen. The canteen is very big and could
                    accommodate many students at a time. We have a coupon system, where the students who would like to
                    have food from the canteen, would require buying coupon for the desired item from the counter during
                    the first short recess of the day in school.</p>

                1. Class attendance is an important predictor of academic success, but students encounter behavioral
                barriers preventing them from attending. In this experimental study, we investigated a commitment
                intervention to improve online attendance among university students (n = 973) during the COVID-19
                pandemic. In the experimental condition, we asked students to commit to attending all classes and
                divided this group into students who made the commitment and those who did not commit.

                <br>
                2. No intervention effect was found when comparing students’ attendance in the experimental condition to
                the control condition, but students who made the commitment attended class more often than
                non-committing students and those in the control condition. Exploratory analyses revealed that the
                intervention effect was found in the course with lower attendance, indicating that a ceiling effect
                possibly prevented the intervention from showing results regarding attendance.

                <br>
                3. However, exploratory analyses also revealed selection bias as a possible explanation for the effects.
                Additionally, the intervention backfired for non-committing students, reducing their attendance. Future
                research should focus on different strategies to improve online attendance.
